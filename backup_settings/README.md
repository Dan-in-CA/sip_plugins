SIP Backup Settings Plugin
==========================

This plugin allows remote access (download and upload) of all the 
settings data necessary for SIP configuration.

This facilitates complete rebuild or replacement of the system without losing any SIP 
settings or log data, or needing physical access to the device to backup data files.  It also 
facilitates testing (test scenarios can be easily saved and restored) or seasonal reprogramming.

Once installed, the plugin provides a button to download all settings in a compound json file.
At a later date, this file can be uploaded again to restore the settings and log data.
