<h1>Buzzer Plugin Documentation</h1>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am not responsible for any damage that the use of this
plugin may cause. Use this plugin and these instructions at your own risk.</p>

<h2>About the Buzzer Plugin</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This plugin has been created to provide simple audio 
feedback. A total of 1 GPIO pin is used on the Raspberry Pi for this 
plugin. </p>

<h2>Installing the Hardware</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>These instructions assume that you are using B+, version 2, 
version 3, or pi zero hardware. To use other models of the Raspberry Pi, 
buzzer.py may need to be modified to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Connect the buzzer so that pin 32 of the Raspberry Pi goes to
the positive terminal of the buzzer and the negative terminal of the buzzer
goes to one of the ground pins of the Raspberry Pi (one of 6, 9, 14, 25, 30,
34, or 39). Note that the total current that may be supplied to all pins of the
Raspberry Pi is 50 mA. It is up to the reader to make sure that the selected
buzzer does not draw too much current from the Raspberry Pi. </p>

<h2>Buzzer</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The buzzer profiles may be changed from the keypad settings
page. By default, the following beeps are used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four beeps: The buzzer plugin has been enabled</p>

<h2>Using the Plugin</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This plugin is intended to be signaled from external plugins. 
From another plugin, instantiate a 'buzzer_beep' signal, and then send the 
signal either a single beep length value in seconds or a list of values in the 
format [on time, off time, ...]. See below for an example of this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
# get open sprinkler signals <br>
from blinker import signal <br>
# instantiate buzzer signal <br>
buzzerSignal = signal('buzzer_beep') <br>
# beep for 1.5 seconds <br>
buzzerSignal.send(1.5) <br>
# send a series of beeps <br>
buzzerSignal.send([0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1]) <br>
