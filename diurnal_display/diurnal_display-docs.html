Diurnal Display Plugin</H2>
<P>This plugin shades the home page schedule graph to illustrate sunrise and sunset times.
It also serves as a test and illustration of the capabilities of plugins to augment the user interface
in powerful ways. Note that this plugin does not provide any new capabilities for defining programs
relative to sunrise or sunset, it alters the presentation only.</P>

<H2>Usage</H2>
<P>This plugin requires a library called "suncalc".  To install type the following into a terminal window:</P>
<CODE>pip3 install suncalc</CODE>
<P>This may raise an error "externally-managed-environment."  There are various ways to address this, but a simple solution
    is to break the external management, with these two lines, and then try the installation again:</P>
    <code>cd /usr/lib/python3.11</code><br/>
    <code>sudo rm EXTERNALLY-MANAGED</code>
<P>This plugin requires the new script injection capabilities introduced in late 2024, please ensure you are running
    a current SIP version for this plugin to work.</P>
<P>The plugin consists of the plugin code (<CODE>plugins/diurnal_display.py</CODE>), the plugin javascript insertion (<CODE>/scripts/static/diurnal_display.js</CODE>)
    the plugin settings page (<CODE>/templates/diurnal_display.html</CODE>), and this documentation (<CODE>/static/docs/plugins/diurnal_display-docs.html</CODE>,
    as well as a manifest listing each of these files: (<CODE>/plugins/manifests/diurnal_display.manifest</CODE>).  A settings file is automatically created
    at <CODE>/data/diurnal_display.json</CODE>.</P>
<P>After installation or enablement of the plugin, go to the Plugins menu and select the settings for the Diurnal Display Plugin, which 
    allow you to enter latitude and longitude coordinates for your location.</P>
<P>The home page schedule graph will now shade night times (before sunrise, after sunset).</P>

<H2>How the plugin works</H2>
<P>Besides installing the plugin itself and handling the pages for setting the latitude and longitude parameters,
    the plugin provides an API at <CODE>/diurnal_display-data</CODE> which can be called from the UI.
    The API accepts a "date" parameter with a day in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. For example <CODE>/diurnal_display-data?param=2024-08-01</CODE>.
    Together with the latitude and longitude retrieved from the settings file, the plugin invokes the library 
    <b>suncalc</b> to calculate sunrise and sunset times.  Note that suncalc requires the date to be in UTC, as well as returning
    the result in UTC, so some conversion into and out of local time is required.</P>
<P>For convenience of the scripts, the sunrise and sunset times are converted into minutes of the day, with 0
    representing midnight, 60 representing 1AM etc.  SIP uses minutes of the day in its programs and logs and thus this
    is a convenient format for the schedule scripts to work with.</P>
<P>At startup the plugin also requests a javascript insertion, <B>diurnal_display.js</B>.  This file attaches an observer to
    the schedule display (see proto plugin for details) and runs a function <B>diurnal_display_update_scheulde</B>
    every time the schedule is updated.  This function calls the plugins data api, and iterates through the schedule
    table adding the correct background color to each row consistent with the sunrise/sunset times.  To limit the augmentation
    to styling, this function adds a transparent background to each cell through CSS.  To enable partiall fills,
    the CSS invokes an in-line SVG that can be dynamically altered to represent the sunrise/sunset line.</P>
