# Monthly Adjust per Station Plugin

Alter the amount of water the station delivers by adjusting the
watering time.

Values can be entered per station per month to indicate
the % adjustment to be applied to the watering time.

If no value is entered for the station/month the value set in the
"Default Adjustment" is used.

If the "Default Adjustment" is not set then
the plugin will take no action for the station/month.
