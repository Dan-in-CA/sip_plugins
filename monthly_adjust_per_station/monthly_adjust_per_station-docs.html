<h1>Monthly Adjust per Station Plugin</h1>

<p>Alter the amount of water the station delivers by adjusting the
watering time. This plugin allows a more fine grained level of control
than the water level setting on the home page.</p>

<p>The plugin will only have an effect on schedules started by programs
triggered automatically and will ignore schedules started with RUN
NOW.</p>

<p>Adjustment levels can be entered per station per month to indicate
the % adjustment to be applied to the watering time.</p>

<p>If no value is entered for the station/month the value set in "Default
Adjustment" is used. If the "Default Adjustment" is not set then the
plugin will take no action for the station/month.</p>

<p>Limitations:
- The plugin does not currently respect the option "Ignore Plugin adjustments".</p>
