		MQTT HASS Plugin</H2>
	<P>The MQTT HASS plugin implement MQTT Discovery for Home Assistant (HASS),
		including report and control of some SIP system settings and valves (stations) over MQTT.
		MQTT Discovery enables automatic devices and entities enrolment from HASS user interface configuration pannel,
		including plug-and-play availability detection, status and control.</P>
	<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="using-the-mqtt_hass-plugin"></A>Using
		MQTT HASS plugin</H2>
	<P>This plugin is disabled by default. If you are reading this, the
		mqtt_hass plugin is probably enabled on your system. Otherwise you can
		enable it using the plugin manager or by setting the group
		permissions of the <STRONG>mqtt_hass.py</STRONG> file to <STRONG>executable</STRONG>.
		Once it is enabled, and the SIP program has been restarted, you can
		verify it is working by selecting it from the PLUGINS drop down menu
		of the main program&rsquo;s web interface. You should be taken to the
		plugin&rsquo;s Settings page.</P>

	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>An MQTT broker such as Mosquitto is required to be accessible by
			SIP device and HASS. This broker can be on different parts of the local
			network, on a remote network, or installed on either SIP or HASS system.</li>
		<li>A working HASS system with an MQTT Integration such as Mosquitto broker</li>
		<li>A SIP system with the base mqtt plugin installed and configured (see bellow).</li>
		<li>This plugin installed and configured on the same SIP system as the base mqtt plugin (see bellow).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Setup</h2>
	<h3>On SIP - base MQTT plugin setup</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Install <i>eclipse paho</i> if not already on the Pi</li>
		<li>Install the base mqtt plugin</li>
		<li>Configure base MQTT plugin</li>
		<ul>
			<li>MQTT Broker Host: This will be the URL of the MQTT broker or localhost if the
				broker is running on SIP</li>
			<li>MQTT Broker Port: Default is 1883 but may be different depending on your
				MQTT broker</li>
			<li>MQTT Broker Username: Default is mosquitto but depends on your setup.</li>
			<li>MQTT Broker Password: Depends on your setup. Use pass as default</li>
			<li>MQTT Publish up/down topic: It needs to be set for proper SIP availability detection by HASS. We suggest
				to use the SIP System name as set on Options webpage</li>
			<li>MQTT Client ID: A unique name for SIP system. Default is SIP System name but can be
				changed on Options webpage.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<h3>On SIP - MQTT HASS plugin setup</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Install Python <i>python-slugify</i> package if not already on the pi.</li>
		<i>sudo python -m pip install python-slugify</i>
		<li>Install the MQTT HASS plugin.</li>
		<li>Configure MQTT HASS plugin.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Topic prefix: This prefix is used for SIP system parameters and zones published to the MQTT broker.
			</li>
			Leave this option empty to use a slugified SIP System name. This setting will be slugified when saved.<br>
			(Default: System name or 'SIP' if System name is empty).
			<li>Name prefix: Used as prefix for all HASS devices and entities names.</li>
			Leave this option empty to use a SIP System name as prefix. For entities, this setting will be slugified.
			<br>
			(Default: System name or 'SIP' if System name is empty).
			<li>SIP FQDN: SIP network name or IP address. Used to compose the URL link to SIP web interface displayed in
				HASS devices settings.</li>
			Leave this option empty to use SIP hostname or IP address used to connect with the MQTT broker.
			<br>
			(Default: SIP hostname).
			<li>Device is Station name: if checked, use <i>station name</i> as part of HASS Device name.</li>
			Changes to SIP <i>station name</i> will update HASS Device name.<br>
			(Default: unchecked)
			<li>Publish disabled zone: if checked, disabled stations will also be published to the MQTT broker and
				discovered by HASS.</li>
			NOTE: For safety, disabled stations can't be controlled from MQTT nor HASS.<br>
			(Default: unchecked)<br>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h3>On Home Assistant - MQTT setup</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Follow Home Assistant instructions to add MQTT integration via the user interface.</li>
		MQTT discovery feature is enabled by default.
		MQTT integration will detect SIP settings parameters and zones as devices and entities.<br>
		<li>Follow Home Assistant instructions to configure and use the newly added devices and entities.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Multiple SIP system conneted to the same MQTT broker or Home Assistant instance</h3>
	<ul>
		To integrate multiple SIP system, on each SIP:
		<li>Use different "System name" as set on SIP Options webpage. Default SIP System name is "SIP"</li>
		<li>For each base MQTT plugin settings use different MQTT Publish up/down topic and MQTT Client ID.</li>
		<li>For each MQTT HASS plugin use different Topic prefix and Name prefix.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Home Assistant - available SIP Devices and Entities</h2>
	Devices and associated Entities made available with this plugin are:
	<ul>
		<li>Device: SIP (name: <i>NamePrefix</i>)</li>
		MQTT HASS plugin create a single device per SIP system.
		This device regroup the supported SIP system parameters and sensors.<br>
		<i>NamePrefix</i> is MQTT HASS "Name prefix" option.
		Unless specified the associated entities have the same behavior as on SIP home webpage.<br>
		Entities name prefix use a slugified version of the device name (<i>nameprefix</i>).
		Entities:
		<ul>
			<li>Control Entity: SIP System Enable (ID: select.<i>nameprefix</i>_enable)</li>
			HASS "Select entity" showing and controling SIP System Enable (Values: "on", Off")<br>
			Setting it to "off" will disable all other system parameters and zone control from HASS.
			<li>Configuration Entity: SIP Mode (ID: select.<i>nameprefix</i>_mode)</li>
			HASS "Select entity" showing and controling SIP Mode (Values: "Automatic", "Manual")<br>
			<li>Configuration Entity: Rain sensor enable (ID: select.<i>nameprefix</i>_rain_sensor_enable)</li>
			HASS "Select entity" showing and controling SIP Rain sensor enable (Values: "on", "off")<br>
			Same behavior as "Use rain sensor" in SIP Options webpage.<br>
			<li>Configuration Entity: Rain delay timer (ID: number.<i>nameprefix</i>_rain_delay_timer)</li>
			HASS "Number entity" showing and controling SIP Rain delay timer (Range: 0 to 24 hours, Default 0)<br>
			This entity has the following JSON attributes and default values when the timer is active / inactive
			(default):
			<ul>
				<li>Attribute: state</li>
				The number of hours as set from SIP user interface or MQTT (Default 0).
				<li>Attribute: start_time</li>
				Unix time when the delay timer started (Default "None").
				<li>Attribute: duration</li>
				Total number of seconds of the delay timer (Default 0).
			</ul>
			<li>Configuration Entity: Water level adjust (ID: number.<i>nameprefix</i>.water_level_adjust)</li>
			HASS "Number entity" showing and controling SIP Water level adjust (Range: 0 to 100 %, Default 100)<br>
			<li>Diagnostic Entity: Rain detect sensor (ID: binary_sensor.<i>nameprefix</i>.rain_detect)</li>
			HASS "Binary sensor entity" reporting SIP Rain sensor state (Values: "on","off")
			<li>Diagnostic Entity: Running program (ID: sensor.<i>nameprefix</i>.running_program)</li>
			HASS "Sensor entity" showing SIP Running program (Values: "Manual", "Run Once, or program number).
			Zones controlled from HASS are shown as "Run Once" program.
		</ul>
		<li>Devices: Zone (name: <i>nameprefix</i> - Z<i>xx</i> or <i>nameprefix</i> - <i>station name</i>)</li>
		MQTT HASS plugin create one device per SIP station (zone).<br>
		Device name is <i>nameprefix</i> - Z<i>xx</i> unless option "Device is Station name" is checked.<br>
		The number of devices will track the number of SIP "Stations Extensions" set on the Options webpage.<br>
		Each zone device has a single "switch" entity.
		Entity:
		<ul>
			ID is switch.<i>nameprefix</i>.z<i>xx</i> where xx is a double digit from 01 to the number of SIP
			stations.<br>
			Entity name and availability will track changes made on SIP Stations webpage.<br>
			This entity has the following JSON attributes and values:
			<ul>
				<li>Attribute: state</li>
				The actual zone state. Value is "on" when active and "off" when inactive.
				<li>Attribute: start_time</li>
				Unix time when the zone turned "on".<br>
				If state is "off": Value is "None".
				<li>Attribute: duration</li>
				Total number of seconds the zone state will be "on".<br>
				If state is "on": Value is the duration as set from a running program or run once or "Inf" if zone is
				activated from manual mode or from MQTT HASS switch.<br>
				If state is "off": Value is "Inf".
				<li>Attribute: program</li>
				The program number that turned the zone state to "on".<br>
				If state is "on": Value is program number, "Run Once" or "Manual"<br>
				If state is "off": Value is "None"
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h2>Test your setup</h2>
		From HASS and SIP user interface:
		<ul>
			<li>Compare the state of select.<i>nameprefix</i>.enable with SIP web interface System Enable.<br>
				Change the system enable from HASS and SIP to verify that the state is changed on the other end.<br>
				When disabled, observe that all the other HASS system parameters and zone entities are not available in
				HASS user
				interface (grayed)</li>
			<li>With System enable, change one enabled zone state from HASS and verify the zone state on SIP
				webpage.<br>
				Observe the active program is set to "Run Once" when setting a zone "on" from HASS.</li>
		</ul>
