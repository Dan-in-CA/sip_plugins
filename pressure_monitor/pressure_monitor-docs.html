Pressure Monitor Plugin</H2>
<P>Displays a graph of historical water pressure at the bottom of the schedule timeline.</P>
<P>This requires a water pressure sensor, hooked up through Arduino and made available through serial
communication.  Many aspects are hard wired in such as max PSI - it may require modification depending on the
hardware.  This is not intended to be a general-purpose solution.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="using-the-pressure_monitor-plugin"></A>Using the
Pressure Monitor plugin</H2>
<P>Settings include the port of the Arduino which is reading data from the pressure sensor,
	and a Remote URL.  This allows you to fetch the SVG from an alternate RPi (that also has this plugin installed)
	facilitating monitoring pressure from a single source that is feeding into multiple SIP systems (I have 3 systems fed
	by a single pump.)</P>
