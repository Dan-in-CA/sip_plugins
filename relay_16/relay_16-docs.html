<P>This is a modified versions of the relay_board plugin. It is designed for use with 
Raspberry Pi models with a 40 pin GPIO header.</P>
<p>The diagram below shows the GPIO pin header and indicates the pins to use with this plugin.</p>



<p> You can use a relay board with 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 relays or a combination of those up to 16 relays.</p><br>
<p><b>Caution:</b> when using more than 1 relay board, the boards must all be either low-level trigger or all high-level trigger. You can not mix the trigger types.</p><br>
<p>Connect the board(s) to the Raspberry Pi following the channel numbering indicated in blue on the diagram. For example, if you are
connecting a 1 channel relay board and a 4 channel board, connect the first board starting with pin 18 on the Pi and continue with pins 22, 24, 26 and 32.
The relays will then operate as stations 1 through 5.<br>

	<ul>
		<li>
			The 5V and ground pins on the Pi can be used to power 1 or 2 relay boards. If more boards are being used or if more than a couple of relays will be turned on at the same time It is a good idea to use a separate power supply to power the boards.</li><br>
		<li>
			If you are using more than 8 channels and need to increase the number of stations SIP displays, open the <b>Options menu > Station Handling</b> and incrase the number of <b>Extension boards</b>. Increasing the number by 1 will add 8 stations to SIP.</li><br>
		<li>
			If the number of relays you are using is not a multiple of 8 you can hide the unused stations. Open the <b>Stations</b> menu and uncheck the boxes under <b>Enabled?</b> next to the stations you are not using.</li>
